# üìñ Description
**PHANTOM** is a simple Python script that enables a user to text a victim from an anonymous number. The program uses the 'textbelt' API to communicate with a victim using a random generated phone number. Not only can you spoof messages, you can now also receive messages between you and the victim using the integrated webhook option. With an incredibly simple UI, sms spoofing has never been easier!

You are also able to use the API key **textbelt** for one **FREE** message!

### WEBHOOK
It's not necessary to obtain a webhook url, unless you would like to receive messages. You can find a unique webhook url at https://webhook.site/

# üíª Usage
## Sending a Text
Once the program is running, you will be asked to enter the victim's phone number.
```shell script
Phone Number:
```
You will then be prompted to enter a message. This will be the message sent to the victim.
```shell script
Message:
```
Now it is time to add your API key. Input the key provided by https://textbelt.com
```shell script
Key:
```
Now that you are ready to send the message, you will be asked if you would like to receive responses from the victim. If yes, type 'yes'. You will then be given the option to input your webhook url (as shown in the above example). If not, type "no".
```shell script
Would you like to receive reply messages? yes/no
```
Now that all of the steps have been completed, your message will be sent to the victim. You will be asked if you would like to send more messages. If your answer is no, the program will stop running.
## Receiving a Text
During the above process, you will be able to view the responses through your 'webhook.site' url. Be sure to look out for the **POST** requests, as they will contain the victim's responses.


### Now that you have learnt to use **PHANTOM**, be sure to have fun!
